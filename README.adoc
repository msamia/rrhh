= RRHH Microservices

This repository contains several Spring Boot services that compose the human resources system.

== Prerequisites

* JDK 17 must be installed and available in your `PATH`.
* MariaDB should be running locally for development and production profiles. Create databases named `contrato`, `empleado`, `entrenamiento`, `nomina`, `consultas` and `orquestador`.
* Docker and Docker Compose for optional infrastructure (Kafka and Zookeeper). A `compose.yaml` file is provided.
* Tests use the in-memory H2 database so no additional setup is required for them.

== Building and Running Services

Each service module contains its own Maven wrapper script. Navigate to the desired module and execute:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Available modules include:

* `comunes`
* `servicio-contrato`
* `servicio-empleado`
* `servicio-entrenamiento`
* `servicio-nomina`
* `servicio-orquestador`
* `servicio-consultas`
* `API-gateway`
* `servidor-para-descubrimiento`

From the repository root you can build all modules at once:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean package
----

== Running Tests

Execute tests for all modules with:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw test
----

or inside a specific module:

[source,bash]
----
cd servicio-contrato
./mvnw test
----

== Docker Compose

A minimal Docker Compose configuration is included to start Kafka and Zookeeper required by the services:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up -d
----

Ensure your local MariaDB instance is running with those databases created before starting the services. Tests will automatically use H2.

== Documentation

Running `./mvnw package` converts this file into `target/html/README.html` using
the Asciidoctor plugin.

== Postman Tests

Sample Postman collection files are provided under `docs/postman`. Import `rrhh-saga-tests.postman_collection.json` into Postman to try the SAGA create, update, delete and status flows via the `/api/saga/empleado-contrato` endpoints. The file `consultas-saga-tests.postman_collection.json` contains additional requests that validate how `servicio-consultas` is updated after each POST, PUT and DELETE operation. The response from the initial POST stores the generated employee and contract identifiers in the collection variables `{{empleadoId}}` and `{{contratoId}}` so that the following requests can reuse them automatically.

For deletions, pass both the employee id and the `contratoId` as a query parameter, e.g. `DELETE /api/saga/empleado-contrato/5?contratoId=10`.
Use `GET /api/saga/empleado-contrato/{sagaId}` to inspect a saga's state.

To check if the circuit breaker for employee creation opens, make several failing requests (for instance by stopping `servicio-empleado`) and then send a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8095/actuator/resilience4j/circuitbreakers/crearEmpleadoCB?includeState=true`.
If the endpoint returns *405 Method Not Allowed*, verify that the `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include` list contains `resilience4j.circuitbreakers` and that the `management.endpoint.circuitbreakers.enabled` property is set to `true` in `servicio-orquestador/src/main/resources/application.properties` so the actuator endpoint is available. The `Resilience4jEndpointConfig` class inside `servicio-orquestador` registers the actuator beans (`CircuitBreakerEndpoint`, `RateLimiterEndpoint`, etc.) when auto-configuration is not triggered.

The `Estado Circuit Breaker crearEmpleadoCB` request in the Postman collection expects the breaker state to be `OPEN`.
